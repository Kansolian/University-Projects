# University-Projects
A Repository housing all code relating to various University projects. In addition to a thorugh explanation of other projects conducted throughout my 5 years in academia

## Bachelor years
* `Autonomous Systems` - Code was lost given a faulty laptop, still mentioned given its impact on my knowledge base. The project resulted in building a laser Tag companion robot named ALTO, image can be seen in the folder. Build while using two arduino boards in conjunction.
 * `Bachelor Thesis` - “A Deep Learning Approach On Fusion Technique Comparison Applied To Affordance Classification”.
* `Cognitive Neuroscience` - Group based analyses of brainwaves. No code given assignment based nature, thus no open exploration of the task.
* `Computational Linguistics` - Assignment testing semester acquired knowledge.

 * `Foundation of Databases` - This project consists of the creation of a database. The topic chosen was Formula 1.
 * `Knowledge Representation` - Project for inference logic, programmed in Prologue.

* `Multi-Agent Systems` - Covid interaction study simulated in NetLogo.

* `Research Workshop` - Project paper: "A deeper deeper look into online reviews of mental disorders and their impact on Natural Language Processing".
* `Software Engineering` - A bird detection app based on sound and images for android. The folder shows the parts I contributed. The app did not fully work in the end, given inexperienced group members in programming.


## Master Years
* `Cognitive Models of Language Learning` - Project Paper: "Unraveling a Linguistic Enigma: Computational Approach to Understanding Specific Language Impairment in Children”
* `COmputer Games` - The project consisted of creating 3 game AI’s, “No Thanks” (card game), “Take5” (card game), “Neverwinter Nights” (Team based capture the flag).
* `Core Topics Cognitive Science` - Project Paper: “Imitative behaviour of the Mirror Neuron System on Attention. The impact of the Genschow et al. (2017) paper on the taxonomy of Attention”.
* `Core Topics AI` - Project Paper: “The Social Robot: Is the safe way, the right way?”.
* `Ethics` - Essay Paper: “Asimov’s Three laws of robotic”.
* `Research skills` - This folder houses the Image Analyses and spatio temporal assignments.
* `Brain Computer Interfacing` -  Project Paper: "A Multimodal Analyses of a passive Brain Computer Interface for Workload Detection”.
* `Complex Systems` - Project Paper: ”Forecasting Food Price Indices in the United States: Using Time-Series Forecasting Models Based On Complex System Paradigms”.
* `Deep Reinforcement Learning` - Simple Walk simulation in python Gymnasium.
* `Bayesian Modelling of Cognitive Processes` - Project based on a Multinomial simulation approach on the effect of Cognitive Dissonance. Title: “The Effects of Self-Esteem on Drug Relapse”.
* `Deep Learning` - Project Paper: “FRAM: Facial Recognition Applied to Mouth Movement. A Feature Analysis On A Lip Reading Paradigm”.
* `Internship` - Internship consisted of creating an opponent, field and Ball detection system for soccer-playing humanoid robots (NAO) (RoboCup).
* `Master Thesis` - "THE POWER OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS IN SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS - 
 A study on search behaviour and strategy development in multi-agent systems situated in an adversarial environment".
The folder houses the thesis and data evaluation code. The implementation code can be found here: https://github.com/Kansolian/The-power-of-Multi-agent-systems-in-Search-and-Rescue-Missions.git.
All code was written by me and all code taken from other authors is clearly stated.
