## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Scientific Background
Cognitive dissonance is a psychological state that arises when a conflict between an individual's beliefs and actions leads to psychological discomfort. Individuals seek to reduce this discomfort by changing their attitudes, beliefs and behaviors or justifying the dissonance through rationalization (Cooper & Fazio, 1984). Cognitive dissonance is common in addiction, as individuals are aware of the harmful consequences of their actions yet persist in engaging in them. This causes an internal struggle as individuals work to justify their actions. They often do this by downplaying the risks or reinterpreting the significance of their behavior to ease the dissonance (Rosenfeld et al., 1984). 

The Self-Standards Model (SSM) explains that individuals with high self-esteem may be particularly affected by the discomfort of cognitive dissonance. Their tendency to hold themselves to higher personal standards increases their motivation to justify or rationalize their behavior when dissonance arises (Stone & Cooper, 2003). This justification can involve minimizing the perceived risks of addiction, referencing the behavior of peers, or adjusting self-perceptions to better align with the addictive behavior, thereby reducing the psychological discomfort associated with dissonance.

Social context plays a crucial role in cognitive dissonance and its resolution. Rosenfeld et al. (1984) highlight that impression management—the desire to appear consistent to others—can influence how dissonance is experienced, depending on the surrounding environment. In the context of addiction, individuals may construct narratives to rationalize their behavior, framing it as justifiable or logical. This internal conflict, between acknowledging the harm caused and continuing the addictive behavior, helps explain why individuals with addiction often resist change even when presented with clear evidence of its consequences. To reduce dissonance, they may adopt strategies such as focusing selectively on information that supports their actions or exaggerating the difficulties associated with making a change.

Addressing addiction requires interventions that tackle both the internal and external aspects of cognitive dissonance. Implementing strategies that challenge the rationalizations individuals use to justify their behavior is crucial. These efforts should be combined with creating a supportive environment that reduces the pressure for impression management while addressing underlying dependencies. This approach can help individuals confront their dissonance more effectively and move toward meaningful change.

Our research aims to address the question: What is the impact of self-esteem on inducing a cognitive dissonance effect for rationalizing a positive emotional response to drug relapse? In this study, we focus on understanding how self-esteem contributes to cognitive dissonance and the rationalization of addictive behaviors.

### 1.2 Data
The dependent variable in our research is the emotional response in the case of drug relapse as well as abstaining, while the primary predictor is self-esteem. Additionally, we include a range of other predictors, based on their significant correlations reported in the literature, to explore their influence on the process  (Safari Hajat Aghaii et al., 2012). These predictors include Personal Characteristics (PC), Behaviors (Be), Feelings and Emotions (FE), Marital Satisfaction (MS), Impulse Control (IC), Economic Factors (EcoF), Legal Factors (LeFa), Family Factors (FF), Thoughts and Beliefs (TB), Subcultural Approval (SA), and Cultural-Educational Factors (CEF). By analyzing these relationships, our goal is to understand how self-esteem contributes to cognitive dissonance and its resolution, specifically in the context of addiction.

### 2.3 Likelihood and linear Regression parameters
Self-esteem being the main predictor in our study and us wanting to find if said predictor has specific effect on our results. We thus implement a logisitc regression on said factor. The following section displays the interplay between all parameters and the final likelihood:

alpha ~ Normal(0, 1)

beta  ~ Normal(0, 1)

pred = alpha + SE*beta

The base behevaior of the User is set with personality characteristics and Behavior

base = PC + Be

The internal Factors consist of Feelings, Marital Satisfaction, Impulse Control and Base Behavior

inter = FE + MS + IC + base

The external Factors consist of Ecological and Legal Factors

ext = EcoF + LeFa

This creates the final probabilities, abstaining being an interplay of internal and external factors. Thoughts and Beliefs in conjunction with Family Factors and our target predictor create the dissonance probability. Finally The rationalization is compiled by the Subcultural Approva, Cultural-educational Factor and the target predictor.

ab  = inv_logit(inter $\cdot$ ext)

noD = inv_logit(TB + FF + pred)

ra  = inv_logit(SA + CEF + pred)


The tree gives us the following thetas:

theta_NR_C = ab

theta_R_C  = (1-ab) $\cdot$ (1-noD) $\cdot$ ra

theta_R_DC = (1-ab) $\cdot$ noD + (1-ab) $\cdot$ (1-noD) $\cdot$ (1-ra)

To get the final results we use a categorical distribution for our likelihood

ans ~ categorical((theta_NR_C,theta_R_C,theta_R_DC))

theta_NR_C <- rep(Pr_NR_C(ab, noD, ra),N_obs)
theta_R_C <- Pr_R_C(ab, noD, ra)
theta_R_DC <- Pr_R_DC(ab, noD, ra)
theta_sub <- matrix(c(theta_NR_C,
                       theta_R_C,
                       theta_R_DC),
                     ncol = 3)

sim_data_cx <- tibble(self_esteem = SE,
                      ans = c(rcat(N_obs,theta_sub)))

sim_list_h <-  list(N_obs = nrow(sim_data_cx),
                    ans = sim_data_cx$ans,
                    self_esteem = sim_data_cx$self_esteem)

fit <- stan(model_code = model, data = sim_list_h)


```

### 4.2 Fit on synthetic data
```{r}
print(fit,
      pars = c("alpha_SE", "beta_SE","PC", "Be", "FE", "MS", "IC", "EcoF", "LeFa", "TB", "FF", "SA", "CEF"))
```


The model achieved convergence across most of its parameters, with Rhat values consistently near 1, expect for 4 cases being higher than 1.5, indicating that the chains mixed sufficiently and that the parameter estimates are robust. Notably, predictors such as Societal Approval (SA) and Cultural-educational Factor (CEF) exhibited significant posterior means, suggesting their importance in explaining the dependent variable. Parameters like Self-Esteem (alpha_SE and beta_SE) displayed the expected behavior, thus a negative effect on the overall outcome, a big self-esteem means a higher risk of relapse with Discomfort.


```{r}
traceplot(fit, pars =c("alpha_SE", "beta_SE","PC", "Be", "FE", "MS", "IC", "EcoF", "LeFa", "TB", "FF", "SA", "CEF"))
```

The traceplot show a convergence on most of the Factors, yet factors like LeFa does not converge at all as well as some deviations for BE, FE, MS and IC. This might be an effect of not enough observations or the way the model has been setup. All in all, the model does perform adequately.

### 4.3 Parameter recovery check

```{r}
as.data.frame(fit) %>%
  select(alpha_SE, beta_SE, PC, Be, FE, MS, IC, EcoF, LeFa, TB, FF, SA, CEF) %>%
  mcmc_recover_hist(true = c(alpha, beta, mean(PC), mean(Be), mean(FE), mean(MS), mean(IC), mean(EcoF), mean(LeFa), mean(TB), mean(FF), mean(SA), mean(CEF)))

gen_data <- rstan::extract(fit)$pred_ans
ppc_bars(sim_list_h$ans, gen_data) +
  ggtitle ("Posterior predictive check")

```

As with the traceplots, the model seems to be able to recover most of the parameters, as seen in the recovery plots. Thus working as expected, yet given the amounts of parameters there was a realistic notion of the model not performing perfectly as both the trace as well as recovery plots show. The posterior predictive check reinforcing this notion of adequacy.



## 5. Real Data
### 5.1 Fit model
For the real data we sticked closely to the original correlation paper to synthesize our real data, given it was none existant otherwise.

```{r}

)

  # Random inputs for factors (normalized to be between -1 and 1) we could link some of these like PC and Behaviors

```

Given the fit of the model, it performed nearly identical to our synthetic data.

### 5.2 Posterior predictive Check
```{r}
as.data.frame(fit_real) %>%
  select(PC, Be, FE, MS, IC, EcoF, LeFa, TB, FF, SA, CEF) %>%
  mcmc_recover_hist(true = c(mean(results_df$PC), mean(results_df$Be), mean(results_df$FE), mean(results_df$MS), mean(results_df$IC), mean(results_df$EcoF), mean(results_df$LF), mean(results_df$TB), mean(results_df$FF), mean(results_df$SA), mean(results_df$CEF)))

gen_data <- rstan::extract(fit_real)$pred_ans
ppc_bars(real_data$ans, gen_data) +
  ggtitle ("Posterior Predictive Check on the real Data")

```


The posterior predictive check (PPC) further affirms the reliability of the model. The comparison between real data (y) and replicated data generated by the model (y_rep) reveals a close alignment, with overlapping credible intervals that confirm the model’s ability to accurately capture the variability in the data. 

### 5.3 Conclusion
As seen in the recovery plot of the real data, the model fails to truly capture some parameters, yet perfectly captures the overall mean for the posterior predictive check. Taking the duality in account the model seems adequate.


Examining the posterior distributions, predictors such as Thoughts and Beliefs (TB) and Cultural-educational Factor (CEF) emerge as key contributors, with higher posterior means indicating their significance. Predictors like Personal Characteristic (PC) and Economic Factors (EcoF) exhibit moderate effects, suggesting their relevance in the model but with a broader range of uncertainty. Self-Esteem parameters (alpha_SE and beta_SE) continue to exhibit wide credible intervals, reinforcing the idea that their role may be indirect and dependent on interactions with other predictors.

The research question-What is the impact of self-esteem on creating cognitive dissonance and rationalizing a positive emotional response to drug relapse?—is partially answered by these results. While self-esteem alone does not appear to be a dominant predictor, its interaction with other variables, such as Thoughts and Beliefs (TB) and Economic Factors (EcoF), likely plays a crucial role in shaping cognitive dissonance and rationalization. The study additionally depicts an overall negative impact of self-esteem on emotional response on drug relapse.
